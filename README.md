# BulldozerPlugin

This plugin modifies gcode so that the printer head will push the printed model out of the printer, and automatically restart the new one.

This may be used to automate the production.

Warning!! This has great potential to damage your printer. Use only if there's no other choice..

To install, copy the Bulldozer.py file under [cura directory]\plugins\PostProcessingPlugin\scripts.
